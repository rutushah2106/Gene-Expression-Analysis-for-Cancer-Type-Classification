# Gene Expression Analysis for Cancer Type Classification

This project uses machine learning to classify cancer types based on gene expression data. Gene expression datasets are collected from sources like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) are applied to group similar gene expression profiles. Classification algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) are then used to predict cancer types.

## Requirements

The following Python packages are required:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- keras (TensorFlow backend)
- matplotlib

To install the required Python packages, you can use:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn keras matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the input files:**
   - `gene_expression_data.csv`: Gene expression data with the last column as the target (cancer type).

2. **Run the code:**
   ```python
   # Save the code into a file named gene_expression_analysis.py and run it
   python gene_expression_analysis.py
   ```

## Code Overview

### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries
The code starts with importing necessary libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and deep learning.

### Step 2: Load and Preprocess the Data
- **Load Data:** The gene expression data is loaded from a CSV file.
- **Preprocess Data:** The data is normalized using `StandardScaler` and split into training and testing sets.

### Step 3: Apply Clustering Algorithms
- **K-means Clustering:** K-means clustering is applied to group similar gene expression profiles.

### Step 4: Apply Classification Algorithms
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** An SVM classifier is trained and evaluated.
- **Random Forest Classifier:** A Random Forest classifier is trained and evaluated.
- **Neural Network:** A simple neural network is created using TensorFlow/Keras, trained, and evaluated.

### Step 5: Evaluate the Models
The performance of the models is evaluated using accuracy and classification reports.

## Output

The program produces the following outputs:
- **Console Output:** 
  - Accuracy of the SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Network models.
  - Classification reports for SVM and Random Forest models.
- **Plots:** 
  - Bar plots (if any) showing the distribution of data points in clusters or other relevant visualizations.

This README provides a clear overview of the project, its requirements, usage instructions, and a summary of the code functionality and outputs.
